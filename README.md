# NN_for_electrolyzer
Dynamic Modeling of Proton Exchange Membrane Electrolyzers comparing kNN and a neural network as regression methods.
After running the "train_model" script, results are exported to "losses" and "export" files".
"Export" file contains true vs predicted values. "Losses" file contains loss vs epoch data. The number of epochs can be edited in the code for optimal results.
